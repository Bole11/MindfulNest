# MindfulNest

## Project Overview
This was a collaborative project where I was responsible for converting Figma designs into a functional frontend and integrating with a live backend API.

## ⚠️ Note: Backend Status
The backend server for this project is currently offline, so the live demo functionality is limited. However, the code demonstrates:

- API integration patterns
- Handling of JSON data
- Frontend-backend communication
- Team collaboration workflows

## Key Features (When Backend was Active)
- User authentication flow
- Dynamic data fetching
- Real-time updates
- Error handling for API requests
